              <h2>To My Love</h2>
              <p>
                AHHHH i don't even know where to begin. all this love, passion and grace towards you is difficult to put into simple words but I'll try my best to express all my feelings towards you.<br><br>
          
                I don't think you realise how special you are and I mean it. you literally changed who I am (to the better obviously) and I don't mean it metaphorically.<br><br>
          
                You are the best most perfect person I have ever met in my life and I swear you ya Hour that I am very willing to give you everything I have, whether it's my love, money, even soul. I just believe that there is literally nothing more perfect than you. You are the perfect form of human being in my eyes and I assure you that I'll never love anybody else. I love you just like how you are. Love you during your ups and downs. Love you when you love me, love you when you try to love me, and love you even if we are upset with each other. And for me, that is real love. Love that lasts for eternity.<br><br>
          
                Destiny led us here. Led us into having each other in each other's life. To love and care and also share emotions.<br><br>
          
                We have already made a lot of memories together and I am very willing to be making even more. With you and just you.<br><br>
          
                I still remember the first time we ever met and how happy and excited I felt. That stomach ache I had when I first saw you and your glowing face, the way your face was emitting that light out of it and the way I can recognise you between the faces of all these different people. I just knew you were the one. I was shocked... I thought you were an angel. You were stunning. The way you dressed and the way you looked. Your smell. Everything about you is just magical. I still cannot fathom how perfect you are ‚Äî those eyes that get me lost like a wandering trader, or those lips and eyebrows, those eyelashes. Those cheeksssssss (MY FAVVV BTW).<br><br>
          
                I hope you realise how much I am in love with you and I promise that I'll never be any harm to you. I will always be here for you. Whenever and wherever. I hope you love me forever and for eternity. May God grant us the destiny of being together forever and I am ready to pray day and night just to have you between my arms one day. I hope you are happy and pleased with such message and I wish you a great happy 18th birthday here on this earth and I am happy to be part of it. I hope we pass each birthday together, celebrate it together and share every moment of it together. I wish I was in Egypt right now to be celebrating with you but I promise that your patience will be worth it. I promise that in few years I'll be saying these words to you in real life and not just on a screen.<br><br>
          
                Thank you for each beautiful moment we had together, thank you for forgiving me for my mistakes, thank you for changing for me even if it's the slightest change, thank you for being here. Your existence is what keeps me alive and going ‚Äî you, after God, gave me purpose in life. Now all I want in this life, in this dunya, is just to be with you. And be the best human being you could have wished to be with. I'll always try my best to be better. I promise to change for you. I promise to reshape myself just to fit with you. All I want is our happiness. I love you now and forever.<br><br>
          
                Best wishes.<br>
                Your love,<br>
